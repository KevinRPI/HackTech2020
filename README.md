# HackTech2020
These are some of the prototype HTML/CSS things I did during HackTech2020. In our actual project, I used a bit of JS to clear the form though it should be doable in HTML as well by keeping everything under one form. I also learned how to incorporate the free and open to use Google Fonts into our project. A lot of the time spent on my part was learning how to use these technologies as well as Git so we could work on the project simultaneously.
