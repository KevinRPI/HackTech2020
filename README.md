# HackTech2020
These are some of the prototype HTML/CSS things I did during HackTech2020. In our actual project, I used a bit of JS to actually clear the form though it should be doable in HTML as well by just keeping everything under one form. I also learned how to incorporate Google Fonts into our project and overall for a first time doing anything development related, I'm pretty proud of myself.
